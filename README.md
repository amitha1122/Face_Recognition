The project serves as a real-time face recognition security system that monitors a live video feed from the webcam.  and recognizes and verifies known faces. If someone tries to 
access your computer and the face recognition system detects that the person is not recognized (i.e., they are a stranger), the script will call this command to lock the screen. This
prevents unauthorized access to your system, as the user will need to provide the correct login credentials to unlock the screen.
